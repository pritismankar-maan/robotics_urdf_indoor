CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (add_executable):
  Target "odom_node" links to target "class_loader::class_loader" but the
  target was not found.  Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for an
  IMPORTED target, or an ALIAS target is missing?


CMake Generate step failed.  Build files cannot be regenerated correctly.
